#   Task:
# • Apply MLP to the MNIST dataset
# • MLP with one hidden layer
# • Optimize parameters using cross-validation
# • Discuss a good architecture for your framework so that you can reuse software components in later exercises.
# • Output as PDF report / ReadMe
#   • Plot showing error-rate on training and validation set
#     with respect to the training epochs
#   • Accuracy on the test set with optimized parameters
#   • Average accuracy during cross-validation for all investigated kernels (e.g. linear and RBF) and all parameter values (e.g. C and γ ).
